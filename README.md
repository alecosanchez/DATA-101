# DATA-101
This repo is a collection of all of the most significant concepts concepts I learned and programs I wrote during my debut data science class "DATA 101". In this repository you can find my implementation of a few main main algorithms including: decisions trees, linear regrssion, logistic regression, and many others. These algortihms were used to tackle real world problems using large data sets. The respository shows my path from using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to draw conclusions on my own, to implementing algorithms which can make predictions with 95%+ accuracy.
